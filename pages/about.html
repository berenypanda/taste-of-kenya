            <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>John Doe was an accountant at a company potluck when the idea of founding his own restaurant came to him. A colleague of his complimented his cooking, and offered to pay John money if he could whip up a few recipes for him. He accepted the offer. Word of mouth around the office spread, and soon John was overwhelmed with requests to cook dishes.
                </p>
                <p>John had always hoped to eventually pursue entrepreneurship, but it was only when preparing food for his colleagues with the help of his wife that he realized he had something valuable to sell. Drawing from his phenomenal cooking, hospitable spirit, and savvy business knowledge, he took the risk to open his own small restaurant, Taste of Kenya, in 2018.

            <h2>Our Values</h2>
                <p>Here at Taste of Kenya, we are committed to offering the best food and service possible. That's why all of our food is prepared fresh daily, and sourced using organic ingredients. Since 2018, we have expanded our restaurant's size to offer the best dine-in experience. We have a bar, a live band that plays Afro music and reggaeton Friday through Sunday, and outside seating. 
                </p>
                <p>We also offer other options to enjoy our food. If you'd like to take food to go, drop in and tell our hosts you'd like to order to go. Our catering services are a great and affordable addition to birthday parties or business conventions. We also partner with Grubhub and Ubereats for delivery to your home.</p>
